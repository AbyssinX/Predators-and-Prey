* Cycles are still being created. I don't know why 
    I think the issue was caused by applying isReachable function in the wrong direction.
    Moreover, i had functionality to enable dissabled links that shouldn't happen.

* Do predators learn? -- how can i be assured 
    * Do predators need more information to learn?
    * I thought that at least they would start changing their direction when they see their prey. Does this happen?
* Why do predators move, then stop, then dissappear. They shouldn't have an ability to stop.
    I might have fixed it. Confirm this later
    Still do that sometimes
